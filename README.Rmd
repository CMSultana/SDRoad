Building maps of San Diego area roads utilizing tidyverse packages. Figures are built using ggplot. Geospatial data is from the SANDAG GIS Data Warehose (http://rdw.sandag.org) and some supplemental geolocations pulled from google with the geocoding API. Work flow is presented using rmarkdown documentation.
